# Payment Collectors
On Friday, September 15, 2023, Michael Ascot, a Senior Finance Director from SwiftSpend, was checking his emails in Outlook and came across an email appearing to be from Abotech Waste Management regarding a monthly invoice for their services. Michael actioned this email and downloaded the attachment to his workstation without thinking.

The following week, Michael received another email from his contact at Abotech claiming they were recently hacked and to carefully review any attachments sent by their employees. However, the damage has already been done. Use the attached Elastic instance to hunt for malicious activity on Michael's workstation and within the SwiftSpend domain!
